# 🌱 Olive Branch Network (OBN)

**OBN** is a next-generation staking protocol built to create sustainable, on-chain funding for real-world charities while rewarding long-term holders.  
Every stake you make not only grows your holdings but also supports a nonprofit organization you choose — automatically, transparently, and without intermediaries.
