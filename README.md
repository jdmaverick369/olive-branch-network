# 🌱 Olive Branch Network (OBN)

**OBN** is a next-generation staking protocol built to create sustainable, on-chain funding for real-world charities while rewarding long-term holders.

Every stake you make not only grows your holdings but also supports a nonprofit organization you choose — automatically, transparently, and without intermediaries.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Multi-Pool Staking** – Each pool represents a specific nonprofit organization
- **Automatic Reward Splits** – Rewards are split every second:  
  - **88%** to stakers  
  - **10%** to the selected charity pool  
  - **1%** to the network treasury
  - **1%** to the charity fund
  
- **Deflationary Emission Schedule** – Incentivizes long-term holding and protocol sustainability:  

| Years | Global APY |
|-------|------------|
| 1–2   | 10%        |
| 3–4   | 7.5%       |
| 5–6   | 5%         |
| 7–8   | 2.5%       |
| 9–10  | 1.25%      |

- **Charity Bootstrap Permalock** – Allocated from the charity fund to onboard nonprofits. Nonprofits receive 1,000,000 OBN permanently staked, giving them instant rewards from day one while removing tokens from circulation.  
- **Upgradeable Smart Contracts** – Built using UUPS proxies and OpenZeppelin standards  
- **Transparent Tracking** – All stakes, rewards, and distributions visible on-chain
